# Strapi CMS for GWM Indonesia

This is a lightweight Strapi CMS integration for the GWM Indonesia website, primarily used to manage news articles for the Info & Promo section.

## Getting Started

### Starting the CMS Server

From the root directory:

```bash
cd cms
npm run develop
```

This will start the Strapi admin panel at http://localhost:1337/admin.

### Accessing the Admin Panel

- Visit http://localhost:1337/admin in your browser
- Login with your admin credentials
- You can also access the admin panel from the main site by visiting /admin

## Content Structure

### Articles

Each article has the following fields:

- **Title**: The headline of the article
- **Slug**: URL-friendly version of the title (auto-generated but editable)
- **Content**: Main article content (rich text)
- **Excerpt**: Short summary of the article
- **Category**: One of "News" or "Promo"
- **Featured Image**: Main image for the article

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- **List articles**: GET /api/articles
- **Single article**: GET /api/articles/:id
- **Filter by slug**: GET /api/articles?filters[slug][$eq]=your-article-slug
- **Filter by category**: GET /api/articles?filters[category][$eq]=News

## Front-end Integration

The front-end React application fetches data from these endpoints to display:

1. **Info & Promo page**: Shows a grid of article cards with filtering and pagination
2. **Article detail page**: Shows a full article when clicked from the Info & Promo page

## Production Deployment

For production:

1. Make sure to set proper environment variables for database connection
2. Configure proper authentication for the admin panel
3. Consider setting up a CDN for media files
4. Add proper rate limiting and security headers

## Customizing

To modify the content structure:

1. Go to Content-Type Builder in the admin panel
2. Make your changes to the Article type or create new types
3. Update the front-end code to match any schema changes
